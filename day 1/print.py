# Day 1: Simple Printing in Python

# The 'print()' function is used to display text or other output in the console.
# In Python, you can print strings (text), numbers, or a combination of both.

# Printing a simple string
print("Hello, world!")  # This will output: Hello, world!

# Printing numbers
print(42)  # This will output: 42

# Printing multiple values with commas (Python will add spaces between them)
print("I am", 22, "years old.")  # This will output: I am 22 years old.

# You can use single or double quotes for strings in Python
print('Learning Python is fun!')  # This will output: Learning Python is fun!

# Printing multiple lines using escape characters like '\n' for a newline
print("Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3")  # This will output:
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Line 3

# Print doesn't add any formatting by itself, so you can use '\t' for tabs as well
print("Item\tPrice\nApple\t$1\nBanana\t$0.5")  # This will output:
# Item    Price
# Apple   $1
# Banana  $0.5
