# Day 1: Simple Printing in Python

# The 'print()' function is used to display text or other output in the console.
# Let's start with some basic print examples.

# Printing a simple string
print("Hello, world!")  # This will output: Hello, world!

# Printing a number
print(22)  # This will output: 22

# Printing a string and a number together
print("I am 22 years old")  # This will output: I am 22 years old

# Printing another simple string
print("Python is fun!")  # This will output: Python is fun!

# You can print any message you'd like.
# Try printing your name and age below:
print("My name is Shamrouz.")  # This will output: My name is Shamrouz
print("I am learning Python!")  # This will output: I am learning Python!
